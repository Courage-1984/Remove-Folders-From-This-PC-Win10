How to Remove the Folders From “This PC” on Windows 10

Windows 10's "This PC" view doesn't just show hard drives, removable storage devices, and network locations. Unlike the traditional "My Computer" list, it also contains several folders -- but you can hide them and make This PC look more like Windows 7's Computer view.

You can hide the Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Videos and 3D Objects folders -- all of them, or just some of them. This requires a quick little registry hack. They'll only be hidden from the This PC view in File Explorer. You can still access those folders from within your user folder.

1. Navigate to [here]() and download the two zip files.
2. Put them anywhere and extract the apropriate files for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).
3. Now run them and follow instructions.
4. once you have done this now you need to restart explorer.
5. Press Ctrl+Shift+Escape.
6. Click the "More details" option if it's not expanded already.
7. Click the "Processes" tab & look for "Windows Explorer", it's usually all the way at the bottom.
8. Right click "Windows Explorer" and select "Restart".
9. Explorer will restart and the folders will vanish from File Explorer.

BOOM! enjoy
